      <h1>Welcome to Roman's Programming Portfolio</h1>
        
        <p> This website was completed during my time at the University of Rhode Island during CSC106. It is one of the first tasks I completed. 
            This assignment was completed Through trial and error. 
            Also some persistance. 
            This little website will show my completed javascript programs as well as tell you a little bit about myself.<strong> Hope you Enjoy.</strong>
