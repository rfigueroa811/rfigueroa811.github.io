          width="325">
        <p>My name is Roman Figueroa. I'm a young and proud Domincan who was born and raised in the smallest state in the U.S, Rhode Island along with my brothers and sisters.
           I have two older brothers, an older sister, and a younger brother and younger sister, making me kind of the middle child.
           I only ever want to bring joy and happiness to others through kind actions. Material possessions can only get one so far but a good spirit and heart
           is something that is truly priceless, at least that is something I strongly believe. As time continues to go foward I intend to do the same. Through new experiences
           I will grow, gain new skills and abilities, as well as build upon some I already possess.
        </p>
